# scetches

#This is a place where I scetch out ideas for future projects based on Rubaugh/Blaha/Premerlani/Eddy/Lorensen's object oriented development model  illustrated in their book "Object-Oriented Modeling and Design". THIS IS NOT CODE!!! Just a place to practice thinking in an object-oriented way and play with design ideas.
